# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis:
To convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, I am presenting a data analysis report of a bikesharing company in New York. I imported data into Tableau, created and styled worksheets, dashboards and stories. My observations were based on data from August 2019 Citibike data from NYC. I compiled my analysis observing trends in factors such as gender, usertypes, usage trends in days of the week, time and geographical data.
